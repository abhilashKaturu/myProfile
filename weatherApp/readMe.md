My project is a basic weather app that given the city(default DC) will give the city's current temperature, today's high, low, humidity, and windspeed. On the bottom of the web page it gives the temperatures of some global cities.

- Flask was used as the backend framework used to build the website
- Python Open Weather Map API was used
