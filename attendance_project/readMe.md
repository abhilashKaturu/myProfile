This is my attendance project! In this project I created an automated system which tracks whether a certain person is present or absent by detecting their face. By using Computer Vision with OpenCv's library, I was able to use a facial recognition algorithm to train a dataset of people in my roster, and check whether they are present or abset in a given day, and update the day's attentence into a CSV sheet.
