This is my attendance project! In this project, I created an automated system that tracks whether a certain person is present or absent by detecting their face. By using Computer Vision with OpenCv's library, I was able to use a facial recognition algorithm to train a dataset of people in my roster, check whether they are present or absent in a given day, and update the day's attentence into a CSV sheet.
