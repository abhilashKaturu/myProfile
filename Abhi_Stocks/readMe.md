In this project I have created a paper trading website where anyone can practice trading stocks without using actual money!

- This project was built through the Python framework Flask as a backend
- WorkZeug as an encryption tool to encrypt passwords, API key, and other important information
- IEX Cloud API to get the live stock prices in my application
- SQLite as a database to store user information
