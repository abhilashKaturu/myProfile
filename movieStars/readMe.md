In this project, I created a program through which you can check the relation of one Movie Star to another Movie Star and how many Degrees of Seperation they have in between

Ex:

Input-

Name: Dwane Johnson
Name: Allu Arjun

Output - 

3 degrees of separation.
1: Dwayne Johnson and Priyanka Chopra starred in Baywatch
2: Priyanka Chopra and Prakash Raj starred in Toofan
3: Prakash Raj and Allu Arjun starred in Gangotri



- IMDb movie database was used to get information about the Movies
- Breadth-First search algorithm was implemented
