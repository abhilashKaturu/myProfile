In this project, I created a program through which you can check the relation of one movie star to another movie star and how many degrees of seperation they have in between each other. This algorithm will find the most shortest path between the two actors.

Ex:

Input-

Name: Dwayne Johnson

Name: Betty White

3 degrees of separation.

1: Dwayne Johnson and Susan Sarandon starred in Snitch
2: Susan Sarandon and Dana Delany starred in Light Sleeper
3: Dana Delany and Betty White starred in Gaia Symphony II



- IMDb movie database was used to get information about the Movies (the full database is too big to be stored in GitHub so a smaller version of it has been stored for demonstration purposes in the /small folder)
- Breadth-First search algorithm was implemented
